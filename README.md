# Computer Architecture Assignments

## [Assignment 1](https://github.com/pavlosdais/Computer-Architecture-II/tree/main/assignment1)
Created a program (using the [QtMips](https://github.com/cvut/QtMips) simulator) to reverse-engineer information about the configuration of a system's microprocessor using 2 pieces of information:
- The number of cycles the program execution lasts.
- The output of the program.

Using these pieces of information we can uniquely identify the configuration that the microprocessor uses for:
- Data Hazards control
- Control Hazards control

## [Assignment 2](https://github.com/pavlosdais/Computer-Architecture-II/tree/main/assignment2)
Created a program that efficiently calculates the result of `X = X + A*B`. Where X, A & B are matrices.

The program takes into account the program's energy usage, meaning we primarily tried to implement an energy-efficient program using different array sizes.
